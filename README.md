# mvp_aaa_codelabs
This codelab goes over the procedures used to prepare and analyze genomes from the Million Veterans Project on Google Cloud.  

### Part 1: [BigQuery Setup](./BigQuery-Setup.md)
This part of the codelab goes over the necessary steps to create tables in BigQuery with genomic information.  

### Part 2: [Sample Level Quality Control](./Sample-Level-QC.md)
This section explains and demonstrates the methods used to perform quality control on each sample in our cohort.

### Part 3: [Variant Level Quality Control](./Variant-Level-QC.md) 
This section explains and demonstrates the methods used to perfrom quality control on each variant in the genomes.

###  Part 4: [QC Implementation](./QC-Implementation.md)
This part of the codelab demonstrates execution of the QC pipeline, removing low quality samples, and flagging low quality variants.


The overall workflow discussed here is visualized in the workflow below.
