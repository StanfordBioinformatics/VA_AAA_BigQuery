# mvp_aaa_codelabs
This codelab goes over the procedures used to prepare and analyze genomes from the Million Veterans Project on Google Cloud.  

### Part 1: [BigQuery Setup](./BigQuery-Setup.md)
This part of the codelab goes over the necessary steps to create tables in BigQuery with genomic information.  

### Part 2: [Sample Level Quality Control](./Sample-Level-QC.md)
This section explains and demonstrates the methods used to perform quality control on each sample in our cohort.

### Part 3: [Variant Level Quality Control](./Variant-Level-QC.md) 
This section explains and demonstrates the methods used to perfrom quality control on each variant in the genomes.

### Part 4: [Final Table Generation](./Final-Table-Generation.md)
This part of the codelab demonstrates how to create BigQuery tables with samples and variants flagged that did not pass quality control.

### Part 5: Analysis

### Part 6: Biological Significance
